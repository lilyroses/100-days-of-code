# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 0: 07.18.2025

**Today's Progress**: 
  - Implement functions for pset3 of MIT's OpenCourseWare course 6.100L (Intro to CS and Programming Using Python) for score of 4.8/5

**Thoughts:** 
  - Must implement the final function, `get_tfidf`, to pass final big test case which is failing for some reason.
  - Try using regular dictionaries instead of `defaultdict` ? When I run the tests on my own, `==` returns `True`. Running the pset3 tests file still fails the last test.
